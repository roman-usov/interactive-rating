## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

1. Developed the overall HTML structure
2. Created desktop styles for the rating form, including the states
3. Created desktop styles for the thank-you card
4. Wrote javascript code for selecting a rating, submitting it and displaying the thank-you card
5. Added a fade-in and a fade-out class to accompany the hidden class
6. Wrote javascript code that sets up an event listener for the transitionend event and enables the rating form to fade out first using transition and the thank-you card to fade-in

### Built with

- HTML5 & CSS3
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

1. Practiced creating a sticky footer
   For that:
   - created a parent container that houses the rating form and the thank-you card
   - turned the body into a flex container with the flex-direction set to column
   - allowed the parent container to grow

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container-parent {
  flex: 1 0 auto;
}

.attribution {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

2. Practiced creating a hidden class accompanied by a fade-in and a fade-out class to add a bit of smoothness `to the transition from the rating form to the thank-card

```js
ratingFormEl.addEventListener(
  'transitionend',
  (ev) => {
    ev.preventDefault();

    ratingFormEl.classList.add('out-of-flow');
    thankYouEl.classList.remove('out-of-flow');
    thankYouEl.classList.add('not-visible');
    thankYouEl.classList.add('fade-in');
  },
  {
    capture: false,
    once: true,
  }
);

ratingFormEl.classList.add('fade-out');
```

```css
 .out-of-flow {
  display: none;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.not-visible {
  opacity: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
}

.fade-out {
  opacity: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
  transition-property: visibility, opacity;
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

.thank-you-content.fade-in {
  visibility: visible;
  opacity: 1;
  transition-property: visibility, opacity;
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```
3. Learned that arbitrarily using 'all' with the transition property can result in unwanted too elastic switching from the desktop view to the mobile view

4. Learned about the transitionend event that allows working around the display: none not supporting transitions

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
